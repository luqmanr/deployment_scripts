## To automatically change the ownership of image files created by a docker container
## incrontab monitors specified folders, and change the ownership to the desired user

1. Install incron
```
sudo apt-get install incron`
```

2. Allow user `root` to use incron
```
sudo nano /etc/incron.allow
```

3. Add the user `root` to the files
```
root
```

4. Specify which directory and which user you want to have ownership of the directory
```
sudo incrontab -u root -e
```
```
<directory-to-monitor> IN_CREATE /bin/chown -R <user>:<group> <directory-to-change-ownership>
```
the command above has three parts

a. `<directory-to-monitor>` = the directory to monitor for created files
b. `IN_CREATE` = when `<directory-to-monitor>` undergoes a change, it will then execute the next part
c. `/bin/chown -R <user>:<group> <directory-to-change-ownership>` = the command to execute when a change to `<directory-to-monitor>` happens
